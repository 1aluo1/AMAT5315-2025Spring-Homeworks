Q1
(1) 
Tropical(3);
Tropical(4);
Tropical(0);
Tropical(-inf).

We can use "typeof(Tropical(1.0))" and "supertype(typeof(Tropical(1.0)))" to distinguish between two types.

If Tropical is defined via struct, then it is a concrete type. If Tropical is defined via abstract type, then it is an abstract type.

It is a concrete type.
